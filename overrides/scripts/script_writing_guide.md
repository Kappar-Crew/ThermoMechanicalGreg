# Kappar Crew Script writing guide
# Hey, i'm here :D 

## Scripts are organized by:

Mod Folder -> [machine_name].zs

In case of a crafting table recipe use

Mod Folder -> [modname].zs


If a recipe requires a recipe name use "pack" in front of the recipe name.

The recipe name itself should be the crafted item name in one word with capital letters to separate the words.
